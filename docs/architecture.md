# nsplane Architecture

This page describes what is on `main`. The target design and roadmap are in
[design.md](design.md).

## Crates

| Crate | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `nsplane-noise` | `crates/nsplane-noise/` | The Noise protocol state machine (`noise`); no I/O |
| `nsplane-packet` | `crates/nsplane-packet/` | Packet buffers (`PacketBuf`, `PacketPool`, `PacketBatch`), IP header views, shared value types (`PeerId`, `TransportId`, `Path`, `Ecn`) |
| `nsplane-core` | `crates/nsplane-core/` | Sans-I/O engine core: peers, cryptokey routing, timers, path policy, packet filters |
| `nsplane` | `crates/nsplane/` | Tokio driver: `Engine`, `EngineBuilder`, `EngineHandle`, events, the I/O traits, `UdpTransport` |
| `nsplane-acl` | `crates/nsplane-acl/` | Accept-only ACL policy engine (`AclEngine`), the `AclFilter` and `FlowTracker` packet filters |
| `nsplane-tun` | `crates/nsplane-tun/` | OS TUN devices as `PacketSource`/`PacketSink` |
| `nsplane-uapi` | `crates/nsplane-uapi/` | The `wg` UAPI over an `EngineHandle`; Unix socket listener |
| `nsplane-cli` | `crates/nsplane-cli/` | Linux/macOS development daemon: TUN + engine + UAPI |

## nsplane-noise

- `noise`: transport-agnostic protocol core. `Tunn` owns the handshake, the session ring,
  the timers, and the per-peer packet queue. It never does I/O: callers pass datagrams in
  and get back a `TunnResult` telling them what to write and where.
  - `handshake`: Noise_IKpsk2 handshake and cookie handling.
  - `session`: transport-data AEAD and the anti-replay window.
  - `rate_limiter`: mac1/mac2 verification and cookie replies under load.
  - `timers`: the WireGuard timer state machine (rekey, keepalive, expiry).
- `noise::wire`: `zerocopy` views of the four message layouts. Transport data is sealed
  and opened in place (`Tunn::encapsulate_in_place` / `decapsulate_in_place`).

## nsplane-core

`Core` performs no I/O and keeps no clock of its own. A driver feeds it `Input`s (local
packets, received datagrams, configuration changes) with `handle_input`, calls
`handle_timeout` when `poll_timeout` is due, and drains `poll_output`: datagrams to
transmit, packets to deliver, and events. Packets go through in place: a local packet is
sealed in its own buffer and leaves as the transmit, a datagram is opened in its buffer and
leaves as the delivery; buffers come back through `recycle`. Peers are looked up by key,
session index and allowed IP (cryptokey routing). Path selection and roaming are delegated
to a `PathPolicy` (`StandardRoaming` by default), local packet rewriting and interception to
`PacketFilter`s.

## nsplane (driver)

One owner task owns the `Core` and loops: it waits for a handle command, a local packet, a
received datagram or the core's next timeout, feeds the core and drains its outputs. Four
I/O tasks surround it, each connected through a bounded queue (1024 packets by default):

```text
PacketSource ─► source task ─┐                       ┌─► transmit task ─► Transport::send
                             ├─► owner task (Core) ──┤
Transport::recv ─► recv task ┘          ▲            └─► sink task ─► PacketSink
                                        │
                          EngineHandle commands (64)
```

The core is never shared, so there are no locks on the data path.

- `EngineHandle` sends commands to the owner (peers, keys, allowed IPs, path, transport,
  stats, injection, shutdown) and returns their replies.
- Events are published on a `broadcast` channel (`EngineHandle::subscribe`); publishing never
  blocks, and a lagging subscriber loses the oldest events.
- Drops are counted per reason (`EngineHandle::drop_counters`) and published as events.

Backpressure:

- Local packets are never dropped by the engine: when the transmit queue is full, datagrams
  wait in the owner task and the owner stops reading local packets until they have moved to
  the queue, which holds back the source.
- Datagrams caused by received datagrams or timers that find the waiting datagrams at the
  queue capacity are dropped (`DROP_TRANSMIT_FULL`).
- A full sink queue drops the decrypted packet (`DROP_SINK_FULL`); a closed sink or
  transport drops with `DROP_SINK_CLOSED` / `DROP_TRANSPORT_CLOSED`, and without a transport
  datagrams are dropped with `DROP_NO_TRANSPORT`.
- An I/O side that reports `BrokenPipe` stops its task; the engine keeps running without it.

`UdpTransport` is the network side: one dual-stack UDP socket with fwmark and ECN support.
`ChannelSource`, `ChannelSink` and `ChannelTransport` are in-memory implementations for tests
and embedders.

## nsplane-tun

`Tun::create` opens a TUN device, `Tun::from_fd` (Unix) adopts one, and `Tun::split`
yields a `TunSource` and a `TunSink` registered with the tokio reactor.

- `linux`: `/dev/net/tun` (Linux, Android), raw IP packets.
- `darwin` and `utun`: the utun control socket (macOS, iOS), packets framed by a 4-byte
  address-family header.
- `unix`: non-blocking fd I/O shared by both.
- `windows`: a Wintun adapter; a reader thread feeds the source.

## nsplane-uapi and the CLI

`Uapi` answers `get=1` and `set=1` over an `EngineHandle`; `listen_port` and `fwmark` bind a
new `UdpTransport` and install it with `EngineHandle::set_transport`. On Unix,
`UapiListener` binds `/var/run/wireguard/<iface>.sock`. Windows has no listener yet.

`nsplane-cli` builds a tokio multi-thread runtime (`--threads` workers), creates the TUN,
builds an engine on it, binds an ephemeral UDP port, serves the UAPI, drops privileges to
`SUDO_UID`/`SUDO_GID`, and runs until SIGINT or SIGTERM.

## nsplane-acl

`AclEngine` holds the compiled `AclPolicy` (host aliases, accept-only rules, built-in tests)
behind an `ArcSwapOption`: evaluation takes no lock, `load` compiles and runs the policy's
tests and swaps it in atomically, and a rejected policy leaves the previous one in effect.
With no policy loaded every request is denied. `merge_layered` combines a local and remote
policies with per-rule provenance; `apply_deny_scope` removes rules reaching forbidden
CIDRs before compilation, so matching stays accept-only.

`AclFilter` is a `PacketFilter` for the engine's filter chain. Inbound packets become
`AccessRequest`s whose principal (a WireGuard key or a terminate binding with a tunnel IP)
comes from a `PeerIdentity`; anything not accepted is dropped with a `reasons` constant.
Non-first IPv4 fragments follow the outcome of their first fragment, and outbound TCP/UDP
packets record reply allowances (with an idle timeout) so replies to flows the local side
opened pass. `FlowTracker` placed after it counts packets and bytes per flow in a bounded
table.

## Unsafe code

`unsafe` lives only in `nsplane-tun`'s platform
modules (`unix`, `linux`, `darwin`, and loading Wintun in `windows`), each with SAFETY
comments. `nsplane-packet`, `nsplane-core`, `nsplane`, `nsplane-acl`, `nsplane-uapi` and `nsplane-cli` declare
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. See `docs/decisions/2026-10-01-unsafe-code-in-boringtun.md`.

## Crypto

- ChaCha20-Poly1305 (transport data, handshake fields): `aws-lc-rs` (`aws-lc-sys` C/asm core,
  the pma-rust pre-sanctioned crypto exception).
- Constant-time comparisons: `subtle`.
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 (cookies), BLAKE2s, HMAC: RustCrypto.
- X25519: `x25519-dalek`.

## Testing

`just check` runs the unit and integration tests of every crate (the engine against
in-memory channels). `just e2e` (`scripts/e2e/linux.sh`) runs `nsplane-cli` against kernel
WireGuard in two containers.
